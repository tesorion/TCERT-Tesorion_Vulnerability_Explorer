# Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer
Tesorion Vulnerability explorer is an easy-to-use application to support Incident Response teams finding vulnerabilities for a given application, and enriching it with information to score the probability of exploitation with the power of EPSS.

Determining how an adversary gained access to the IT infrastructure is essential during incident response cases. The Adversary trail may lead to an application or device, which “magically” led to initial access, privilege escalation or lateral movement. The “magic” in these cases is the exploitation of a vulnerability residing in an application or device. 

With the vast number of applications and devices in use today, it is impossible to be aware of all vulnerabilities. Being able to quickly identify relevant vulnerabilities, specifically those with a high chance of exploitation, will enhance the abilities of incident response teams to quickly respond and minimise impact.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a well-known system, developed by FIRST. CVSS is a powerful metric to score the potential impact of a vulnerability, but not the likelihood of that vulnerability being exploited. That is where the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), also developed by FIRST, comes into play. EPSS provides a system to score the chance a vulnerability will be exploited in the next 30 days for a given date.

Although the initial use-case for developing EPSS was the prioritization of patches during a patch management process, T-CERT (Tesorion Computer Emergence Response Team) believes it can also be used to identify potentially exploited vulnerabilities during an incident response engagement. To leverage the power of EPSS, T-CERT created the Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer application. This easy-to-use application enriches the NIST NVD CVE database with the corresponding CVSS and EPSS scores as well as the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Using the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) notation system, you can easily filter for a specific product.

The Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer gets its power from combining different scoring systems and frameworks. More information about those can be found in the overview below:
* EPSS - Exploit Prediction Scoring System - An open, data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. This system is build and maintained by FIRST.
- https://www.first.org/epss/
* CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - The registration system for keeping track of known vulnerabilities. Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer uses the enriched dataset set from the NIST NVD, which is built upon and fully synchronized with the CVE List.
- https://nvd.nist.gov/
* CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System - An open framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. The framework is developed and maintained by FIRST. The scores for individual CVEs are assigned by NIST NVD.
- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss
- https://www.first.org/cvss/
* CPE - Common Platform Enumeration - A structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. The CVE information from the NVD is enriched with the impacted products in the CPE format. Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer leverages this format, to select vulnerabilities for specific products.
- https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe
* CISA KEV catalog - CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog - CISA keeps track of vulnerabilities identified as known to be exploited in the wild.

We credit FIRST, NIST and CISA for their effort building and maintaining the respective scoring systems and frameworks.

## Getting started
For Windows
- Download the released executable. All required packages are included.
- Start the executable, no external dependencies exist.

For Windows, MacOS and Linux
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed
- Clone the repository
- Install the required packages
> pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start the application
> python3 .\Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer.py

## First time usage
During the first start, an SQLite database is created in the current working directory. To fill the database with CVE, EPSS and KEV data, perform the following action:
* Click the button "Update all". This will perform the following three actions:
- Update CVE - Download all CVE and CVSS information from the NVD since 2010.
- Update CISA - Download the CVEs listed by CISA as known exploited.
- Update EPSS - Download the EPSS scores from First, for all existing CVEs.
* Monitor the process using the console at the bottom of the screen.
* Once all data is loaded, the tables are populated and ready to use.

## Usage
Regular user flow:
* Make sure your data is up-to-date. You can hit either the "Update All" button to update all sources, or the specific update buttons to update the information of a specifc source.
* Filter on either CPE or CVE to find relevant vulnerabilities.
* You can sort on a column by clicking the respective header.
* You can view more detailed information regarding a vulnerability by double clicking an item in the table. A pop-up will be displayed.
* Export data to Excel for more fine-grained searching or reporting purposes. The current filter is applied to the export.

## Behaviour
* CPE filter
Provide a valid CPE filter string and hit the button "Filter on CPE". With the help of the respective NIST API, the CVE-number(s) of products matching the CPE filter will be returned. This is limited to the first 2000 CPE matches. In case the limit is reached a warning is given in the console at the bottom of the screen. Make the CPE filter more specific to reduce the number of matches. 

One CPE match may be related to multiple CVEs. Several CPE matches can have overlapping CVEs, these are deduplicated.

The following format is used to build a CPE filter string. Each field may contain a wildcard (*), excepted for the “cpe:2.3” part.
* cpe:2.3:<part>:<vendor>:<product>:<version>:<update>:<edition>

Fields explained:
* cpe:2.3 – this is a static string for the used version of CPE, and already prefilled in the search box.
* <part> - this field is either of the following three options:
- a – application
- o - operating system
- h – hardware
* <vendor> - The name of the vendor.
* <product> - The name of the product.
* <version> - The version of the product.
* <update> - Update or service pack information, also referred to as minor version.
* <edition> - A further granularity describing the build of the product.

NIST developed a search engine for CPE on their website, which is a great help for building and testing your CPE filter strings. You can find the engine here: https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe/search

You apply either the CPE or the CVE filter. 

* CVE filter
Enter a valid CVE number, or multiple CVE numbers seperated by a comma (,) and click the button "Filter on CVE".

You apply either the CPE or the CVE filter. 

* Enter the "Dark"
Enable dark mode

* Back to the "Light"
Enable light mode

* Export to Excel
Export the current displayed CVEs to Excel. The current filter is applied on the export. By removing all filters, a full export of all data can be created.

* Update CVE
The CVE and CVSS information is updated from the NIST NVD. Data is downloaded per year, and only if newer data is available. The data is stored in the Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer database.

* Update CISA KEV
The CISA KEV catalog is downloaded from CISA and stored in the Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer database.

* Update EPSS
The EPSS information is downloaded from FIRST for the given date and stored in the Tesorion Vulnerability Explorer database.

* Update all
Perform an update on all data sources. This will perform the following actions:
- Update CVE - Download all CVE and CVSS information from the NIST NVD since 2010.
- Update CISA KEV - Download the CVEs listed by CISA as known exploited.
- Update EPSS - Download the EPSS scores from FIRST, for all existing CVEs.

* EPSS Date
The EPSS framework includes a time element, as the probability of exploitation of a vulnerability is time dependent. The value of this field is used by the "Update EPSS" process. The EPSS date must be in the past and in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". By default the field is populated with the date of Yesterday, as the data of today might not be available yet.

* Console
A listing of the actions performed and events generated by the application.
